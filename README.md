# Lambda Players - Half-Life 1 Weapon Pack
 Adds Half-Life 1 weapons (except for Gluon Gun, Tripmine, Satchel Charges, and Snarks) for [Lambda Players](https://github.com/IcyStarFrost/Lambda-Players/) bots' equipment.

 Half-Life: Source content is not required to be mounted, as the addon already has required assets needed for weapons to work properly in it.
